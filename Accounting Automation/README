Hello, Badar Wiryawan from Accounting Diponegoro University here. Welcome to my accounting automation project.

This program is completely made by myself with Python. You can use it for free by running it in a code editor. I recommend Visual Studio Code, but you have to install the necessary things first such as Python itself and related libraries (Pandas). Another alternative is Google Colab which already has Pandas in it.
